            <p>
              <strong>Startups and small teams</strong> — founders shipping quickly who need audits,
              cloud and identity hardening, privacy documentation, and answers for enterprise
              security questionnaires.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Individuals and families</strong> — people dealing with compromised accounts,
              malware, stalkerware, data leaks, identity theft risk, or simply wanting a safer setup
              across phone, laptop and cloud storage.

                <h3>Discovery call</h3>
                <p>
                  A short, free conversation to understand your setup, your risks and your
                  deadlines.

                  We review infrastructure, accounts, data flows and policies, and reproduce real
                  issues.
